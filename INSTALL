This is the installation file for the Cunctator package.

PREREQUISITES
You will need the following installed and configured properly on your 
system before building Call Commander:

X11 Window System
Needed for building on Un*x-type systems, including Linux.  Virtually 
all Linux distros should include this.

Qt Toolkit, v3.2 or better
Most modern Linux distros include this.  It's typically installed as part
of the KDE Desktop Environment, although KDE is by no means required.
It can also be downloaded directly from TrollTech (ftp://ftp.trolltech.com/).
